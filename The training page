<div class="description">HIV/AIDS
    This training highlights the vital connection between HIV/AIDS and 
    substance use, emphasizing how behaviors such as intravenous drug 
    use and high-risk sexual activity can increase HIV transmission rates. 
    Counselors explore the medical and psychosocial aspects of HIV/AIDS, 
    including current treatments, prevention strategies (e.g., pre-exposure 
    prophylaxis, or PrEP), and harm reduction measures. Special attention 
    is given to addressing stigma, confidentiality (particularly in relation 
    to HIV status disclosure), and cultural competency when working with 
    diverse populations affected by HIV. By the end of the session, 
    counselors will be prepared to integrate HIV screening, education, 
    and prevention into substance use disorder treatment plans, enhancing 
    overall client care and public health outcomes.

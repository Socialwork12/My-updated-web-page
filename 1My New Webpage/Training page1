                        a broad overview of how substance use progresses from experimental or recreational 
                        stages to severe dependence, offering counselors insight into key terms such as 
                        tolerance, withdrawal, and dependence. Participants will explore the biopsychosocial
                         model of addiction, which examines biological, psychological, and social factors 
                         contributing to substance use. By completing this course, counselors can expect 
                         to gain a strong foundational understanding of addiction, learn common terminology,
                          and appreciate the complexity of factors that influence clients substance use.</P>
